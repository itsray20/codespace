Here's a step-by-step explanation of how the selection sort algorithm works:

1. The code prompts the user to enter the size of the array (n) and then creates an array of that size.

2. It then asks the user to input the elements of the array.

3. The code starts the sorting process by using two nested loops: the outer loop iterates from the first element (i = 0) to the second-to-last element (i < n - 1), and the inner loop iterates from the element next to the outer loop's current position (j = i + 1) to the last element (j <= n).

4. Inside the nested loops, the code compares the current element at index j with the element at index i. If the element at index j is smaller than the element at index i, it means that the current minimum element is found, and the code proceeds to swap these two elements.

5. After the inner loop completes, the smallest element among the remaining unsorted elements is placed at its correct position (i.e., at index i).

6. The outer loop then moves to the next position (i++), and the process is repeated until the second-to-last element.

7. Finally, the code displays the sorted array.

The selection sort algorithm works by repeatedly finding the minimum element from the unsorted portion of the array and placing it at the beginning of the sorted portion. It gradually builds the sorted sequence from left to right.
