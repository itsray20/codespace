2. 1.The `main()` function is the entry point of the program.

2. The variables `n`, `i`, `nextterm`, `t1`, and `t2` are declared as integers. These variables will be used to store the necessary values for generating the Fibonacci sequence.

3. The line `cin >> n;` prompts the user to enter a value for `n`, which represents the number of Fibonacci numbers to be generated.

4. The `for` loop is used to iterate `i` from 1 to `n` (inclusive). This loop will generate the Fibonacci sequence.

5. Inside the loop, the current value of `t1` is printed using `cout << t1 << endl;`. This prints the value of `t1` on the console.

6. The next term in the sequence, `nextterm`, is calculated by adding `t1` and `t2` together: `nextterm = t1 + t2;`.

7. The values of `t1` and `t2` are then updated to prepare for the next iteration. `t1` is set to the current value of `t2`, and `t2` is set to the current value of `nextterm`. This ensures that the correct values are used to generate the next Fibonacci number in the sequence.

8. The loop continues until `i` reaches the value of `n`, generating the desired number of Fibonacci numbers.

this code prompts the user for a value `n`, and then generates the first `n` Fibonacci numbers using a `for` loop. Each Fibonacci number is printed on a new line. The variables `t1` and `t2` are used to keep track of the current and previous terms, while `nextterm` calculates the next term in the sequence.

code :

#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

int main() {

  int n, i, nextterm, t1 = 0, t2 = 1;

  cin >> n;

  for (i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
    cout << t1 << endl;
    nextterm = t1 + t2;
    t1 = t2;
    t2 = nextterm;
  }
}
