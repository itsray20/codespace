1. The code starts by including the necessary header file `iostream` and using the `std` namespace for convenience in using input/output operations.

2. The main function is declared, which is the entry point of the program.

3. Two integer variables, `i` and `n`, are declared. These variables will be used in the following steps.

4. The line `cin >> n;` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `n`. This allows the user to provide the number for which they want to calculate the factorial.

5. An integer variable `fact` is declared and initialized to 1. This variable will store the factorial value as the calculation progresses.

6. A for loop is used to calculate the factorial. It starts with `i` being assigned the value 2, and the loop continues as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`. In each iteration, `i` is incremented by 1.

7. Within the loop, the line `fact *= i;` multiplies the current value of `fact` by `i` and updates the result in the `fact` variable. This operation effectively calculates the factorial of `n`. For example, if `n` is 5, the loop will calculate `fact = 1 * 2 * 3 * 4 * 5`.

8. Once the loop completes, the value of `fact` will be the factorial of the given number `n`.

9. Finally, the line `cout << fact << endl;` outputs the calculated factorial (`fact`) to the standard output (usually the console). The `<<` operator is used to stream the value of `fact` to `cout` (the standard output stream). `endl` is used to insert a newline character after printing the factorial.

In summary, this code takes a number from the user, calculates its factorial using a for loop, and then outputs the result to the console.

code : 

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int i, n;

  cin >> n;
  int fact = 1;
  for (i = 2; i <= n; i++) {

    fact *= i;
  }
  cout << fact << endl;
}
