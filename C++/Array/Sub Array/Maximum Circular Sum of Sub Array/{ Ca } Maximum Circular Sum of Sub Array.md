This C++ code finds the maximum circular sum of a subarray from a given array of integers. The maximum circular sum is the maximum sum of a subarray that can be obtained by wrapping the array in a circular manner. This means that the subarray can start from the end of the array and continue from the beginning, considering it as a circular structure.

Let's break down the code step by step:

1. The `kadane` function:
The `kadane` function implements the Kadane's algorithm, which is used to find the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray within a 1D array. It takes an integer array `array` and its size `n` as input and returns the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray.

2. `main` function:
- It first takes input for the size of the array `n` and then the elements of the array from the user.

- It then calls the `kadane` function to find the maximum sum of a subarray without considering the circular wrap, and stores the result in `nonwrapsum`.

- Next, it calculates the total sum of all elements in the array and simultaneously negates the elements of the array. This negation will be useful to find the minimum sum of a subarray in a circular manner.

- After that, it calls the `kadane` function again with the negated array to find the maximum sum of a subarray with circular wrapping, and stores the result in `wrapsum`.

- Finally, it prints the maximum circular sum by taking the maximum of `wrapsum` and `nonwrapsum` and displays the result.

3. Explanation of the logic:

- To find the maximum circular sum of a subarray, we have two possibilities: either the subarray lies entirely within the non-wrapped (original) array, or it wraps around the circular structure.

- First, we use the `kadane` function to find the maximum sum of a subarray within the original array (`nonwrapsum`). This is essentially finding the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray without any circular wrapping, using Kadane's algorithm.

- Then, to find the maximum sum of a subarray with circular wrapping, we take the following approach:

  - We calculate the total sum of all elements in the array (`totalsum`).
  - We negate the elements of the array and apply the `kadane` function to find the minimum sum of a subarray within the negated array. This will give us the maximum sum of a subarray with circular wrapping since negating the elements will turn the minimum sum into the maximum sum.
  - We add the `totalsum` (the sum of all elements) to the maximum sum from the negated array to get the maximum sum of a subarray with circular wrapping (`wrapsum`).

- Finally, we compare `wrapsum` and `nonwrapsum`, and the maximum of the two will be the maximum circular sum, which is then displayed as the output.

Note: The code uses the `INT_MIN` constant from the `<climits>` header to initialize the `maxsum` variable in the `kadane` function, ensuring it is initialized to the smallest possible value for integers. This ensures that the `max` function in C++ will return the correct value when comparing it with other sums.

code : #Array 

#include <climits>
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int kadane(int array[ ], int n) {
  int currentsum = 0;
  int maxsum = INT_MIN;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    currentsum += array[i];
    if (currentsum < 0) {
      currentsum = 0;
    }
    maxsum = max(maxsum, currentsum);
  }
  return maxsum;
}

int main() {

  int i, j, k, n;

  cout << "Array Size :";
  cin >> n;
  int array[n];
  cout << "Array Elements :";
  for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    cin >> array[i];
  }

  int wrapsum;
  int nonwrapsum;

  nonwrapsum = kadane(array, n);

  int totalsum = 0;
  for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    totalsum += array[i];
    array[i] = -array[i];
  }

  wrapsum = totalsum + kadane(array, n);
  cout << "Maximum Circular Sum of Sub Array : " << max(wrapsum, nonwrapsum);
}
