This C++ program checks whether the word entered by the user is a palindrome or not. A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or other sequence of characters that reads the same forward and backward (ignoring spaces, punctuation, and capitalization). In this case, the word is read as a sequence of characters.

Here's a step-by-step explanation of the logic behind the program:

1. The user is prompted to enter the length of their word, and the input is stored in the integer variable `n`.

2. An array `array` of characters is declared with a size of `n + 1`. The `+1` is for accommodating the null-terminator character '\0', which is required for C-style strings.

3. The user is then prompted to enter their word, and the input is stored in the character array `array`.

4. A boolean variable `flag` is initialized as `true`. This variable will be used to determine whether the word is a palindrome or not.

5. A `for` loop is used to iterate through the character array. The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i < n`.

6. Inside the loop, the program compares the character at position `i` with the character at the position `n - 1 - i`. The `n - 1 - i` calculates the position of the character from the end, effectively comparing the first character with the last, the second with the second-to-last, and so on.

7. If any pair of characters at corresponding positions does not match, the `flag` is set to `false`, indicating that the word is not a palindrome.

8. After the loop finishes, the program checks the value of `flag`. If it is still `true`, that means all the characters were matching, and the word is a palindrome. If `flag` is `false`, it means at least one pair of characters did not match, and the word is not a palindrome.

9. Finally, the program prints the appropriate message based on the value of `flag`.

Let's see an example to understand this better:

Suppose the user enters the word "RADAR":

1. `n` is set to 5 (length of the word).

2. The character array `array` is created as `char array[6]`, and the word "RADAR" is stored in it.

3. The `flag` is set to `true`.

4. The `for` loop iterates from `i = 0` to `i < 5`.

5. In the first iteration (i = 0), the character at `array[0]` is compared with the character at `array[5 - 1 - 0]` (which is `array[4]`). Both are 'R', so the `flag` remains `true`.

6. In the second iteration (i = 1), the character at `array[1]` is compared with the character at `array[5 - 1 - 1]` (which is `array[3]`). Both are 'A', so the `flag` remains `true`.

7. In the third iteration (i = 2), the character at `array[2]` is compared with the character at `array[5 - 1 - 2]` (which is `array[2]`). Both are 'D', so the `flag` remains `true`.

8. The loop continues, and in the fourth iteration (i = 3), the character at `array[3]` is compared with the character at `array[5 - 1 - 3]` (which is `array[1]`). Both are 'A', so the `flag` remains `true`.

9. Finally, in the fifth iteration (i = 4), the character at `array[4]` is compared with the character at `array[5 - 1 - 4]` (which is `array[0]`). Both are 'R', so the `flag` remains `true`.

10. The loop ends, and since the `flag` is still `true`, the program prints "The entered word is a palindrome."

As a result, the program correctly identifies the word "RADAR" as a palindrome.

code 1: #Character_Array 

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {

  int n;
  cout << "\nLength of Your Word : ";
  cin >> n;

  char array[n + 1];

  cout << "Enter Your Word : ";
  cin >> array;

  bool flag = true;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    if (array[i] != array[n - 1 - i]) {
      flag = false;
    }
  }

  if (flag) {
    cout << "The entered word is a palindrome";
  } else {
    cout << "The Entered word is not a palindrome";
  }
}

code 2: #Character_Array  

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  char name[30];
  cin >> name;
  int i = 0;

  int count = 0;
  while (name[i] != '\0') {
    count++;
    i++;
  }

  int n = count;

  bool flag = true;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    if (name[i] != name[n - 1 - i]) {
      flag = false;
    }
  }
  if (flag) {
    cout << "The entered word is a palindrome";
  } else {
    cout << "The Entered word is not a palindrome";
  }
