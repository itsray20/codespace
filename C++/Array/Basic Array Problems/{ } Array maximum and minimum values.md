This code snippet demonstrates the logic for finding the maximum and minimum values in an array in C++.

1. The code includes the necessary header files: `climits`, which provides constants for integer types, and `iostream`, which enables input and output operations. The standard namespace `std` is also declared.

2. The `main()` function is the entry point of the program.

3. The variable `n` and `i` are declared. `n` represents the size of the array, and `i` will be used as a loop variable.

4. The user is prompted to input a value for `n` using the `cin` statement.

5. An integer array called `array` is declared with a size of `n`. The size of the array is determined by the value stored in the variable `n`.

6. A `for` loop is used to iterate `n` times. This loop is responsible for reading input values from the user and storing them in the array. The loop variable `i` is used as an index to access each element of the array. The `cin` statement is used to input values from the user and assign them to `array[i]`.

7. Two variables, `maxn` and `minn`, are declared and initialized to the maximum and minimum possible integer values, respectively. These variables will be used to store the maximum and minimum values found in the array.

8. Another `for` loop is used to iterate `n` times. This loop is responsible for finding the maximum and minimum values in the array. The loop variable `i` is used as an index to access each element of the array. The `max()` and `min()` functions from the `climits` library are used to update the values of `maxn` and `minn` based on the current element being processed.

9. After the loop completes, the program outputs the maximum and minimum values found in the array using the `cout` statement.

10. The program execution completes, and the program terminates.

Overall, this code prompts the user to input the size of an array, reads `n` integer values from the user, stores them in an array, and then finds the maximum and minimum values in the array. Finally, it outputs the maximum and minimum values.

code :

#include <climits>
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

int main() {

  int n, i;
  cin >> n;

  int array[n];

  for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    cin >> array[i];
  }

  int maxn = INT_MIN;
  int minn = INT_MAX;

  for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    maxn = max(maxn, array[i]);
    minn = min(minn, array[i]);
  }

  cout << "Max : " << maxn << " "
       << "Min :" << minn;
}
