This code snippet demonstrates the logic for creating and printing the elements of an array in C++.

1. The code begins by including the necessary header file `iostream`, which allows input and output operations, and declares the standard namespace `std`.

2. The `main()` function is the entry point of the program.

3. The variable `n` is declared to store the size of the array. The user is prompted to input a value for `n` using the `cin` statement.

4. An integer array called `array` is declared with a size of `n`. The size of the array is determined by the value stored in the variable `n`.

5. A `for` loop is used to iterate `n` times. This loop is responsible for reading input values from the user and storing them in the array. The loop variable `i` is used as an index to access each element of the array. The `cin` statement is used to input values from the user and assign them to `array[i]`.

6. Another `for` loop is used to iterate `n` times. This loop is responsible for printing the elements of the array. Similar to the previous loop, the loop variable `i` is used as an index to access each element of the array. The `cout` statement is used to output the value of `array[i]` followed by an `endl` to move the output to the next line.

7. The program execution completes, and the program terminates.

Overall, this code prompts the user to input the size of an array, reads `n` integer values from the user, stores them in an array, and then prints the elements of the array.

code :

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int n;
  cin >> n;

  int array[n];

  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    cin >> array[i];
  }

  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    cout << array[i] << endl;
  }
}
