This code is used to create a 2D array to represent a matrix and then take input for the elements of the matrix from the user. Finally, it prints the matrix as output. Let's go through the code step-by-step and explain the logic behind it:

1. The code starts by including the necessary header file `iostream`, which is required for input and output operations.

2. The `using namespace std;` line allows you to use the standard C++ library functions and objects without explicitly specifying the `std::` namespace prefix.

3. Inside the `main()` function, the following variables are declared:
   - `i` and `j` are loop counters used to iterate over the rows and columns of the matrix.
   - `n` and `m` are integers that store the number of rows and columns of the matrix, respectively.

4. The user is prompted to enter the size of the matrix. They are asked to input the number of rows and columns (`m` and `n`).

5. A 2D array `array[n][m]` is declared to store the elements of the matrix. This array can hold `n` rows and `m` columns, as specified by the user.

6. The code then prompts the user to input the elements of the matrix. It uses nested loops to iterate over each element of the matrix and stores the input in the `array`.

7. After receiving all the input elements, the code prints the matrix as output. It uses another set of nested loops to traverse through each element of the `array` and displays it on the screen.

The logical flow of the code is as follows:
- The user is asked to provide the size of the matrix (number of rows and columns).
- The code creates a 2D array with the specified number of rows and columns.
- The user is prompted to input the elements of the matrix row by row.
- The code stores the entered elements in the respective positions of the 2D array.
- Finally, the code displays the matrix on the screen, row by row.

Keep in mind that there is no error handling for invalid inputs (e.g., negative size of the matrix or non-numeric inputs for matrix elements). It would be a good idea to add some validation checks in a real-world application to handle such cases.
