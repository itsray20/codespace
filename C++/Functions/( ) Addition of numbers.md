1. The code starts by including the necessary header file `iostream`, which allows input and output operations, and declares the `std` namespace for convenience.

2. The code defines a function called `add` that takes two integer parameters `num1` and `num2`. This function is responsible for adding the two numbers and returning the result.

3. Inside the `add` function, a new integer variable `sum` is declared and initialized with the sum of `num1` and `num2`. This line calculates the sum of the two input numbers.

4. The `return` statement is used to return the value of `sum` back to the caller of the `add` function.

5. The `main` function is the entry point of the program.

6. Inside the `main` function, two integer variables `a` and `b` are declared.

7. The user is prompted to enter values for `a` and `b` using `cin`. The values entered by the user are stored in the variables `a` and `b`.

8. The line `cout << "Addition is " << add(a, b);` outputs the string "Addition is " to the console, followed by the result of calling the `add` function with the arguments `a` and `b`. This line calculates the sum of `a` and `b` by invoking the `add` function and displays the result.

9. The program ends, and the `main` function returns 0.

In summary, this code prompts the user to enter two numbers, `a` and `b`, and then adds them together using the `add` function. The `add` function calculates the sum of two numbers and returns the result, which is then displayed on the console by the `cout` statement in the `main` function.

code:

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int add(int num1, int num2) {

  int sum = num1 + num2;
  return sum;
}

int main() {

  int a;
  int b;
  cin >> a >> b;
  cout << "Addition is " << add(a, b);
}
