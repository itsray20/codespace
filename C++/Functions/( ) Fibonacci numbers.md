This code implements the Fibonacci sequence using functions in C++. The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers in which each number (after the first two) is the sum of the two preceding ones. In this code, the `fib()` function calculates and prints the Fibonacci sequence up to the given number `n`.

Here is a step-by-step explanation of the code's logic:

1. The code starts by including the necessary header file `<iostream>`, which provides input/output operations.
2. The `using namespace std;` statement allows the use of standard C++ library functions and objects without explicitly specifying the namespace.
3. The `fib()` function is defined to calculate and print the Fibonacci sequence up to the given number `n`. It takes an integer parameter `n` that represents the number of terms to be printed.
4. Inside the `fib()` function, two variables `t1` and `t2` are declared and initialized to 0 and 1, respectively. These variables represent the first two terms of the Fibonacci sequence.
5. A loop is started with `i` initialized to 1 and running until `i` reaches `n`.
6. Within the loop, the value of `t1` is printed using `cout << t1 << endl;`, displaying the current term of the Fibonacci sequence.
7. The next term `nextterm` is calculated by adding `t1` and `t2`.
8. The value of `t1` is updated to `t2`, and `t2` is updated to `nextterm`, preparing for the next iteration of the loop.
9. After the loop finishes, the `fib()` function ends.
10. In the `main()` function, an integer variable `n` is declared to store the input value from the user.
11. The value of `n` is obtained from the user using `cin >> n;`.
12. The `fib()` function is called, passing the value of `n` as an argument, which will calculate and print the Fibonacci sequence up to `n`.
13. Finally, the `main()` function returns 0, indicating successful program execution.

Overall, this code uses a function `fib()` to calculate and print the Fibonacci sequence up to the given number `n`. It separates the logic of the Fibonacci sequence calculation from the `main()` function, making the code more modular and reusable.

code:

#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

void fib(int n) {
  int t1 = 0, t2 = 1;
  int nextterm;
  for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
    cout << t1 << endl;
    nextterm = t1 + t2;
    t1 = t2;
    t2 = nextterm;
  }
}
int main() {
  int n, i, nextterm, t1 = 0, t2 = 1;

  cin >> n;

  fib(n);
  return 0;
}
