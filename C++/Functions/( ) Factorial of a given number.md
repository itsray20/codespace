This code calculates the factorial of a given number using functions. Here's how it works logically:

1. The code begins by including the necessary header file `iostream`, which allows input/output operations, and using the `std` namespace for convenience.

2. Next, there is a function named `fact` that takes an integer `n` as a parameter and returns the factorial of `n`. The factorial of a number is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to that number.

3. Inside the `fact` function, there is a variable named `factorial` initialized to 1. This variable will hold the result of the factorial calculation.

4. A `for` loop is used to iterate from 2 to `n` (inclusive) because the factorial of 0 and 1 is always 1. The loop multiplies the current value of `factorial` by the loop counter `i` in each iteration.

5. After the loop completes, the final value of `factorial` is the factorial of the input number `n`. This value is returned by the `fact` function.

6. The `main` function is the entry point of the program. It declares an integer variable `n` to store the user input.

7. The `cin` object is used to read an integer value from the user, which is then stored in `n`.

8. Finally, the `fact` function is called with `n` as an argument, and the result is printed using the `cout` object.

In summary, this program prompts the user to enter a number, calculates its factorial using the `fact` function, and then displays the result.

code :

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int fact(int n) {
  int factorial = 1;
  for (int i = 2; i <= n; i++) {
    factorial *= i;
  }
  return factorial;
}

int main() {
  int n;

  cin >> n;

  cout << fact(n);
}
